Abstract: Currently, Real-time Linux is evaluated using a black-box approach. While this method provides an overview of the system, it fails to provide a root cause analysis for unexpected values. Developers have to use kernel trace features to debug these cases, requiring extensive knowledge about the system and fastidious tracing setup and breakdown.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vhpc.github.io/2023/jsa_si/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vhpc.github.io/2023/jsa_si/</guid><description>Special Issue: Virtualization in High-Performance Cloud Computing Journal of Systems Architecture (JSA) Elsevier a first quartile Scientific Journal Ranking/CiteScore ranked journal

McKenney, Software Engineer at Meta Abstract:
RCU is used heavily as a replacement for reader-writer locking. But it is not a reader-writer lock. RCU is also used as a replacement for reference counting. But it is not a reference counter. RCU is used to provide type-safe memory. But it is not type-safe memory. RCU is used for many things, but it is none of those things.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vhpc.github.io/2023/program/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vhpc.github.io/2023/program/</guid><description>VHPC 2023 Program For exact timing and schedule of the contributions, please, refer to the schedule page.

This talk provides an in-depth overview of the ROCm software ecosystem on MI300X platforms, with a focus on large-scale training and inference of Large Language Models. It will also introduce some new use cases that leverage the new Spatial Partitioning modes and Virtualization capabilities to accelerate these workloads. Additionally, we will discuss some of the challenges and tools available for profiling, tuning, and debugging these complex systems, empowering developers to optimize their workloads and unlock the full potential of MI300X.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://vhpc.github.io/schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vhpc.github.io/schedule/</guid><description>VHPC 2024 Schedule For detailed information on the contributions, including full authorship, please, refer to the program page.
