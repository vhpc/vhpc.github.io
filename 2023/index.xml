McKenney, Software Engineer at Meta Abstract:
RCU is used heavily as a replacement for reader-writer locking. But it is not a reader-writer lock. RCU is also used as a replacement for reference counting. But it is not a reference counter. RCU is used to provide type-safe memory. But it is not type-safe memory. RCU is used for many things, but it is none of those things.</description></item><item><title>18th Workshop on Virtualization in High-Performance Cloud Computing</title><link>https://vhpc.github.io/2023/home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vhpc.github.io/2023/home/</guid><description>The Workshop on Virtualization in HighÂ­-Performance Cloud Computing (VHPC) aims to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners facing the challenges posed by virtualization in HPC/Cloud scenarios in order to foster discussion, collaboration, mutual exchange of knowledge and experience, enabling research to ultimately provide novel solutions for virtualized computing systems of tomorrow.
