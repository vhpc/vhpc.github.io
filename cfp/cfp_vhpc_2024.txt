Call for Papers

Containers and virtualization technologies constitute key enabling
factors for flexible resource management in modern data centers, and
particularly in cloud environments. Cloud providers need to manage
complex infrastructures in a seamless fashion to support the highly
dynamic and heterogeneous workloads and hosted applications customers
deploy. Similarly, HPC environments have been increasingly adopting
techniques that enable flexible management of vast computing and
networking resources, close to marginal provisioning cost, which is
unprecedented in the history of scientific and commercial computing.

Various virtualization-containerization technologies contribute to
the overall picture in different ways: machine virtualization, with
its capability to enable consolidation of multiple under­utilized
servers with heterogeneous software and operating systems (OSes),
and its capability to live­-migrate a fully operating virtual machine
(VM) with a very short downtime, enables novel and dynamic ways to
manage physical servers; OS-­level virtualization (i.e.,
containerization), with its capability to isolate multiple user­-space
environments and to allow for their co­-existence within the same OS
kernel, promises to provide many of the advantages of machine
virtualization with high levels of responsiveness and performance;
lastly, unikernels provide for manyvirtualization benefits with a
minimized OS/library surface. I/O virtualization, in turn, allows
physical network interfaces to exchange traffic with multiple VMs
or containers; network virtualization, with its capability to create
logical network overlays independently from the underlying physical
topology, is another fundamental enabling technology for Cloud/HPC
infrastructures.  Last, storage virtualization needs to evolve to
support increasingly demanding requirements in terms of performance
and reliability for the managed application data.


Publication

Accepted papers will be published in a Springer LNCS proceedings volume.

  memory to allow flexible and efficient allocation across multiple
  workloads, enabling higher utilization of GPU resources

  and page table structures that allow both GPUs to address CPU memory
  mapped to accelerator global memory space

- Distributed memory virtualization
- Memory compression and reduction techniques: approaches for
  compressing model parameters, activations, and gradients to reduce
  memory requirements during training
- Out-of-core training algorithms
- Efficient memory allocation and management: Techniques for optimizing
  memory allocation, reducing fragmentation, and improving memory
  utilization during training

  processing techniques that minimize memory overhead while maintaining
  training efficiency

  measuring, analyzing, and optimizing memory usage in
  LLM training workloads
- Case studies and applications: Real-world examples and applications of
  virtualization techniques in LLM training scenarios


The Workshop on Virtualization in High­-Performance Cloud Computing
(VHPC) aims to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners
facing the challenges posed by virtualization in order to foster
discussion, collaboration, mutual exchange of knowledge and
experience, enabling research to ultimately provide novel solutions
for virtualized computing systems of tomorrow.

The workshop will be one day in length, composed of 20 min paper
presentations, each followed by 10 min discussion sections, plus
lightning talks that are limited to 5 minutes. Presentations may be
accompanied by interactive demonstrations.
